## Features
 ## Health Data Input
      Users can add metrics like Step Count, Water Intake, etc.

      Each entry includes a timestamp and numeric value.

      Input is validated to prevent empty or invalid submissions.

📊 Data Visualization
    Health data is shown in a table (most recent entries first).

    Interactive Line/Bar charts (via Recharts) to track trends.

    Toggle views for Today, Last 7 Days, and Last 30 Days.

🔍 Filtering & Sorting
    Filter data by Time of Day (Morning / Afternoon / Evening).

    Sort values by ascending/descending order.

##  Tech Stack

-  **React** + **TypeScript**  : Component-based architecture and static typing
-  **Vite** (blazing-fast dev build) : Fast build tool and development server
-  **Tailwind CSS**  : Utility-first styling
-  **shadcn/ui** (modern component library built on Radix UI)  :Accessible components powered by Radix UI
-  **Recharts**  : Graphs for visual data representation
-  **Bun** (for development server and tooling)  : Alternative runtime for speed (optional) , but highly recommended as it's faster
